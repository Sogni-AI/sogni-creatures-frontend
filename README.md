# Sogni Creatures Example Frontend

This is a minimal HTML/CSS/JS demo app showcasing how to use the [Sogni Creatures API](https://github.com/Sogni-AI/sogni-creatures-api) and the [Sogni SDK](https://www.sogni.ai/sdk) to generate adorable AI creatures. 

### Features
- Simple form with dropdowns (animal, color, personality) to craft the prompt.
- Generates images via the `creatures-api.sogni.ai` endpoint.
- Maintains a “history” of generated images, letting you revisit them.

### Prerequisites
- **Backend**: You’ll need the [Sogni Creatures API](https://github.com/Sogni-AI/sogni-creatures-api) running locally or accessible online.

### Setup & Usage
1. Clone this repository (or download the zip).
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Modify `script.js` if you want to point to a different endpoint (if you’re running the API elsewhere).
4. Use the dropdowns to pick an animal, color, and personality—then click **Generate Creature!**
